in.www is a tiny, inetd-based webserver designed for devices with 
limited resources. I use it for streaming mp3 files via HTTP
from my NSLU2 (slug) and running a CGI playlist manager. It uses
just 84K per process when it is running.

SECURITY:
=================

Makefile has some switches for security. All are on by
default:

-DCGI   - Builds with CGI support - remove this switch to disable
          CGI support. Any .cgi file that is executable and
          requested from the document tree will be run.

-DNORELATIVE - Any attempt by a client to use a relative path 
               will result in a 403 error. This prevents 99%
               of web attacks to read the passwd file and break
               out of the document root. If you are worried, you
               could chroot in.www in the inetd startup.

-DONELOG - Output a log file in /var/log/in.www.log in NCSA
           combined format for each request. NOTE: You must run
           in.www as a user with write permissions to 
           /var/log if you use this option.

In addition, all buffers are checked and limited to prevent buffer
overrun attacks.

You can use x/inetd and tcpd as with any other inetd service to 
restrict access from hosts and to limit the number of in.www 
processes.


INSTALLATION:
=================

1. Compile in.www:

   make

2. Copy to your path:

   cp in.www /usr/local/bin
   cp man/in.www.1.gz /usr/local/man

3. Add an inetd entry (this assumes Debian, with user www-data and 
   that the /usr/sbin/tcpd wrapper is available) to inetd.conf:

   www stream tcp nowait www-data /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/local/bin/in.www /var/www

4. Restart inetd


For more info, run "man in.www"
